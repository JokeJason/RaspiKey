      <description>RaspiKey is software for the Raspberry Pi Zero W device. It makes it act as a host for various Bluetooth keyboards and then converts their Bluetooth connection to a plain universal USB HID keyboard connection.
It is particularly useful with the Apple wireless keyboards because it translates their exotic keymap to that of a standard PC USB keyboard. This is an excellent way to get an Apple keyboard to seamlessly and fully work on a Windows PC (or any other device that is not an Apple computer).</description>

      <description>You are free to download and try RaspiKey for as long as you want and see if it works for you as expected and if it fully suits your needs. Unless licensed, RaspiKey will run for 30 minutes and then turn off automatically. When that happens you will have to unplug it from the USB port and plug it back in.
You can currently only request a beta testing license. If you would like one please email: samartzidis@gmail.</description>
